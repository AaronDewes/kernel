# Umbrel OS Kernel for Rockchip CPUs

This is the kernel for unofficial Umbrel OS images for Rockchip devices, currently only the RockPro64 is supported, but other devices might be added in the future.
The kernel contains some customizations and optimizations for Umbrel OS and is forked from [the rockchip-linux kernel](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/kernel).
